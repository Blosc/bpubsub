# Example configuration for a standalone subscriber
#
# It's possible to run only the subscriber. Then the configuration has only a
# section for the subscriber. And maybe another one for the client.

# The subscriber section must define:
#
# - statedir: the directory where the subcriber's data will be stored
# - http: where the subscriber listens to (a unix socket or a host/port)
# - url: the base url users will use to reach the subscriber
# - quota: if defined it will limit the disk usage
#
[subscriber]
statedir = "_caterva2/sub"
#http = "_caterva2/sub/uvicorn.socket"
http = "localhost:8002"
urlbase = "http://localhost:8002"
quota = "10G"
maxusers = 5

# The client section defines the credentials for the client to authenticate
# against the subscriber.
